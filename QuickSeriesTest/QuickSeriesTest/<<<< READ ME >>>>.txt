Hello Justin and QuickSeries mobile team members,

Please find below a few notes concerning the Test App:

- I moved the data folder to within the project files folder

- Categories view and Resources view support a basic debug mode. To test just change actual filename of any of the data files.

- Asynchronous Image loading can be vastly improved for performance (faster loading and very fast scrolling).(Ex: SDWebImage from cocoapods)

- For addresses that contain a gps location longitude and latitude, reverse geolocation can be used

- Sort button can be hidden if resouce list has only one entry (I didn't do it in case it was required in all cases)

- For phone functionality, we can add a check to see if device supports it (ex: iPod)



That's all from my side.

I hope you enjoy testing my app as much as I enjoyed developing it.

Thank you!

Best regards,
Mike Bajakian
