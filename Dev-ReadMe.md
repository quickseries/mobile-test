 Pull and setup the pods and you are good to go


1. The project is finished as per the instruction and a pull request has been made.
2. Within the time constraint of 1 or 2 days and my current work commitments, i have provided a decent work.
3. There are many things which i would've done better, some restricted to improper architecture of Json File, i still dont get why you would have an empty object of address inside an Address Array, or why would u have key names of Days and the working hours inside , rather than a structure with title of day and to and from time in a single object or why would you divide restaurant and vacation spots to two different object while they have all similar entities.
4. What i would've done better was case of how BizHours, Address and Contact is handled ,  keeping the same UI dispersion , i would have structured the json better so i would'nt have to create 7 keys structs for BizHours or all contacs lists for Contacts section.
5. Would have written more test case
6. Would have created a strings file for all strings


    I wear many hats in my currect workplace and my availablity is 24/7, so in between i got the time to finish this test and i beleive it could've been better still thats the best i could do in the time span.
