# Instructions:

- Fork this git repo to your computer
- Create a branch
- When you are done, push your work and create a pull request to the original repo.

# Requirements

*Create a 3 page app.*

- When you launch the app, you should see a list of resource categories (`/data/categories.json`)
- When you click on a category, it should open a list of resources (`/data/restaurant.json` or `/data/vacation-spot.json`)
- When you click on a resource, it should open a details page (see attached mockup)

# Tips:

- You can showcase usage of Dependency Injection and Architecture Component.
- You can show how to handle threads.
- Remember you can always create a side project first and prepare yourself before jumping into the test.
- For JSON, you can use the RAW file version in git hub so you can simulate a call to remote API.

# Notes:

- I wanted to play with SwiftUI + Combine + MVVM for this challenge, I discovered how important is a Coordinator or a Router with SwiftUI, I didn't implemented any of them but It would have been a lot easier and cleaner.
- I also struggled a lot session dataTaskPublisher and github rawdata ended up using regular dataTask with semaphores.
